## api_for_xsolla ##

##Description##
This API was developed by me for Xsolla Summer School 2021.It is designed as a RESTful API and provides features to manage the database, such as deleting, modifying, viewing, and adding new items, in this case products, to the catalog for the e-commerce site.

##Development##
To develop the API, I used the JavaScript programming language, with the Node.JS platform and the Express framework. The database I developed for testing was made on MongoDB and stored on their server. I also used the Heroku service for hosting, which currently hosts my API in a fully working state. 

For the simplest testing of the functions of my database, I developed an application in Python which helps to test the functionality of all features. 

##Launching##
To run the API you need to launch the file api.js
Also in this file you need to set the link to your database as the first argument in the db.connect() function.
